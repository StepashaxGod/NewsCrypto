## PROJECT STRUCTURE

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/` — styles
- `js/` — scripts
- `assets/` — images, utils, e.t.c
- `README.md` — documentation
- `server` - server side (backend)


## PLAN 
- Create an html structure  
- Create css styles 
- Create static data to try out generating code 
- Figuring out the API platforms provide
- figuring out how to make the connection to their server via the node.js because cant test the CryptoPanic api because of the cors
- establishing own server through the node.js via the express frame to avoid the cors (having a different localhost that allows me to retrieve data from third parties)
- localstorage for the news
- creating the archive with news (DB and putting them on a separate page)
